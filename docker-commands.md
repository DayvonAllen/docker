## Basic Docker Commands
- `docker ps` - list all running docker container.
- `docker version` - prints information about docker and the version you are running
- `docker run <image name>` - creates and runs a new instance of a container.
  - `docker run --name <container name> -p 6379:6379 redis` - 'redis' is the image name.
    - This is an example of running redis.
    - `--name` - allows us to give a container a custom name. If you create a container with a custom name, you can't create another container with the same name.
    - `-p 6379:6379` - The first `6379` refers to the port of your computer, the second `6379` refers to the port in the redis container instance. We are mapping the port `6379` in our computer to the port `6379` in the docker container, so programs on our computer can interact with the redis instance. This is called port mapping. We will then use port forwarding when a request comes on that port. When a request comes to `http://localhost:6379` it will be forwarded to the redis container instance to handle.
- `docker stop <container name>` - stops an instance of a container gracefully. Sends a `SIGTERM` signal.
- `docker kill <container name>` - immediately stops an instance of a container. Sends a `SIGKILL` signal.
- `docker rm <container name>` - remove container with a specific name from your local docker cache.
- `docker start -ai <container name>` - You can start containers by name if they exists in your local docker registry. `redis`, `mongo` etc. (are not container names, they are image names). When you use `docker ps -a` or `docker ps --all`, it will list all of the docker containers that are located in your local docker cache and will show you their names.
  - `-ai` - lets you see what's going on in that container.
  - `-a` - makes docker watch for output from the container and prints it out on your terminal.
  - You would run the following command in another terminal window after `docker start -ai <container name>`:
  - `docker exec -it <container name> <command>`
      - `exec` - It's going to let you execute a command in your container.
      - `-i` - Makes the terminal interactive, you can type in the terminal but it's a blank terminal.
      - `-t` - Gives you visual effects like `127.0.0.1:6379>` when used with `i`, so you can see what you are doing and where you are in the terminal.
      - `-it` - Therefore `i` and `t` are always used together like this `-it`, so you can interact with the terminal and have nice visual effects.
- `docker create <image>` - creates a container out of an image.
- `docker system prune` - Will delete all stopped containers and build cache(images from Docker Hub).
- `docker logs <container name or id>` - gets all the logs that are emitted from this container.
- `docker exec -it <container name or id> sh` - gives you access to the terminal in a running container.
- `docker build -t <docker id>/<image name>:<version> <path to Dockerfile>` - builds a container with a custom name. `-t` lets you tag a container.
  - When building a dev dockerfile you need to use this command: `docker build -f Dockerfile.dev .`
    - `Dockerfile.dev` is the name of our dev file and `-f` means you want to specify a file to build
- `docker rm <container-name>` - remove container.
- `docker container prune` - removes all containers from the cache

## Setting Up A Volume
- `docker run -p 3000:3000 -v /app/node_modules -v $(pwd):/app <image id or name>`;
  - `-v $(pwd):/app` - maps the current directory into `/app`
    - `:` means we are trying to map a folder that's outside of the container with a folder that's in the container.
  - `-v /app/node_modules` - puts a bookmark on the `node_modules` folder that's inside the container.
